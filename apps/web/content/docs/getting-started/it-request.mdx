## Why This Matters

Corsair proofs are verified against a **domain-controlled DID** and a **trust.txt** file. In most companies, GRC teams don’t control the root domain, so the safest, standard approach is a delegated subdomain (for example, `trust.example.com`). IT keeps control of the root domain, and GRC gets a narrow, auditable surface for compliance proofs.

## What IT Is Being Asked To Do

Create a subdomain that GRC can control and host static files on:

- `https://trust.example.com/.well-known/trust.txt`
- `https://trust.example.com/.well-known/did.json`
- `https://trust.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json`

This is a **small, one-time change** and can be implemented with a CNAME or NS delegation.

## Option A — CNAME (Simplest)

IT adds a CNAME record:

```
trust.example.com  CNAME  grcorsair-trust.hosting-provider.com
```

GRC then hosts static files on that subdomain. IT retains control of the root domain.

## Option B — NS Delegation (Most Robust)

IT delegates a subdomain to GRC-controlled nameservers:

```
trust.example.com  NS  ns1.corsair-trust.net
trust.example.com  NS  ns2.corsair-trust.net
```

GRC manages DNS only for `trust.example.com`, nothing else.

## Option C — One-Time Domain Proof (Lowest Touch)

If IT won’t delegate a subdomain, they can publish a one-time proof:

- DNS TXT: `_corsair.example.com = <challenge-token>`
- or HTTP: `https://example.com/.well-known/corsair-challenge`

This is less flexible long-term, but still establishes domain control.

## Security Notes (For IT)

- The subdomain hosts **static files only** under `/.well-known/`
- No login, no app, no email, no cookies
- Can be served from a locked-down static host with strict headers
- Scope is limited to trust and verification artifacts

## Copy-Paste Request Email

```
Subject: Request to delegate trust subdomain for compliance proofs

Hi IT team,

We need a dedicated subdomain to publish compliance proof metadata (trust.txt + DID) for customer verification. This is a standard, low-risk setup similar to status.example.com or security.example.com.

Requested subdomain:
  trust.example.com

Preferred DNS option (simple):
  trust.example.com  CNAME  <our-static-host>

Files we will host:
  https://trust.example.com/.well-known/trust.txt
  https://trust.example.com/.well-known/did.json
  https://trust.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json

This is static content only and does not grant access to the root domain.

Thanks,
<Your Name>
GRC / Security
```

## Next Step

Once the subdomain is live, generate DID + JWKS + trust.txt:

```bash
corsair did generate --domain trust.example.com --output did.json
corsair did jwks --domain trust.example.com --output jwks.json
corsair trust-txt generate --did did:web:trust.example.com
```
