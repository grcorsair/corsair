## The Corsair Philosophy

Corsair is built on a single insight: **security tools already generate the evidence, but nobody can cryptographically verify it.**

Traditional GRC tools ask: "Did you document your controls?"
Corsair asks: "Can you prove your controls are effective with a signed, verifiable credential?"

The proof that emerges from tool-generated evidence and cryptographic signing is fundamentally different from self-reported questionnaires.

## The Pipeline

Every Corsair assessment flows through four stages:

| Stage | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **EVIDENCE** | Accept structured tool output (Prowler, InSpec, Trivy, etc.) | Structured controls and evidence |
| **CHART** | Compliance framework mapping | MITRE, NIST, SOC 2, ISO 27001, 10+ frameworks |
| **QUARTER** | AI-powered evidence review | Confidence score and trust tier |
| **MARQUE** | Ed25519 signed attestation | Signed CPOE (W3C Verifiable Credential) |

Two companion systems operate alongside:

- **FLAGSHIP** — Real-time compliance change notifications (SSF/CAEP)
- **SCITT** — Append-only transparency log for CPOE registration

## Tool Adapters

Corsair accepts structured output from security scanning tools and compliance platforms. Each adapter translates tool-native formats into the canonical evidence format for signing:

- **Prowler** — AWS/Azure/GCP security scanning (JSON output)
- **InSpec** — Infrastructure compliance testing (JSON results)
- **Trivy** — Vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning (JSON reports)
- **ComplianceAsCode** — OpenSCAP-based compliance automation
- **Platform APIs** — CISO Assistant, Eramba, and other GRC platforms

## CPOE Assurance Levels (L0-L4)

Every CPOE is issued at an assurance level reflecting the depth of evidence:

| Level | Name | What It Means |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **L0** | Documented | Policy exists, self-attestation only |
| **L1** | Configured | Automated checks confirm settings are in place |
| **L2** | Demonstrated | Test results prove controls work, AI-verified (confidence >= 70) |
| **L3** | Observed | Continuous monitoring active, re-validated within 90 days |
| **L4** | Attested | Independent auditor co-signs the credential |

The CPOE level is the minimum across all in-scope controls. Buyers set their own acceptance thresholds.

## Evidence Chain

Every finding in Corsair is backed by a cryptographic evidence chain:

1. Each evidence record is hashed with SHA-256
2. Each hash includes the previous record's hash (chain)
3. The chain root is included in the Marque signature
4. Tampering with any record breaks the chain

This ensures evidence integrity without trusting any central authority.

## Marque Signing

A Marque is signed with Ed25519 (elliptic curve digital signature):

- **Private key**: Used by the `corsair sign` CLI to sign attestations
- **Public key**: Shared with anyone who needs to verify
- **Verification**: Runs client-side via Web Crypto API at [grcorsair.com/marque](/marque)

No server, no account, no data sharing required for verification.

## Parley Protocol

Parley is the trust exchange protocol that composes three open standards:

| Standard | Role | What It Provides |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **JWT-VC** (W3C) | Proof | CPOE as a Verifiable Credential, Ed25519-signed |
| **SCITT** (IETF) | Audit trail | Append-only transparency log with COSE receipts |
| **SSF/CAEP** (OpenID) | Signals | Real-time compliance change notifications |

Together, these ensure that compliance proofs are verifiable, auditable, and communicated in real time.
