## The Corsair Philosophy

Corsair is built on a single insight: **compliance tools check if controls exist, but never test if they actually work under attack.**

Traditional GRC tools ask: "Is MFA configured?"
Corsair asks: "What happens when an attacker tries to bypass MFA?"

The evidence that emerges from adversarial testing is fundamentally different from configuration scanning.

## The Pipeline

Every Corsair mission flows through eight stages:

| Stage | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **RECON** | Read-only reconnaissance | Service snapshot (JSON) |
| **SPYGLASS** | STRIDE threat modeling | Threat model with severity ratings |
| **MARK** | Configuration drift detection | Drift findings (expected vs actual) |
| **RAID** | Adversarial attack simulation | Attack results (DryRun=true by default) |
| **PLUNDER** | Cryptographic evidence extraction | SHA-256 hash chain (JSONL) |
| **CHART** | Compliance framework mapping | MITRE → NIST → SOC2 → 10+ frameworks |
| **QUARTER** | AI governance review | Confidence score and trust tier |
| **MARQUE** | Ed25519 signed attestation | Signed CPOE document |

## ISC (Ideal State Criteria)

ISC criteria define what "secure" looks like for a given target. Each criterion is:

- **8 words maximum** — concise and actionable
- **Binary testable** — SATISFIED or FAILED, nothing in between
- **One concern per criterion** — granular and specific

Example ISC criteria for a Cognito User Pool:

```
✅ "Multi-factor authentication enforced for all accounts"
❌ "Password policy requires minimum fourteen characters"
✅ "Advanced security features enabled and active"
```

## Evidence Chain

Every finding in Corsair is backed by a cryptographic evidence chain:

1. Each evidence record is hashed with SHA-256
2. Each hash includes the previous record's hash (chain)
3. The chain root is included in the Marque signature
4. Tampering with any record breaks the chain

This ensures evidence integrity without trusting any central authority.

## Marque Signing

A Marque is signed with Ed25519 (elliptic curve digital signature):

- **Private key**: Used by the Corsair CLI to sign attestations
- **Public key**: Shared with anyone who needs to verify
- **Verification**: Runs client-side via Web Crypto API at [grcorsair.com/marque](/marque)

No server, no account, no data sharing required for verification.
