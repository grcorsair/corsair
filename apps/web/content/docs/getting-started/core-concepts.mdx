## The Corsair Philosophy

Corsair is built on a single insight: **security tools already generate the evidence, but nobody can cryptographically verify it.**

Traditional GRC tools ask: "Did you document your controls?"
Corsair asks: "Can you prove your controls are effective with a signed, verifiable credential?"

The proof that emerges from tool-generated evidence and cryptographic signing is fundamentally different from self-reported questionnaires.

## The Pipeline

Every Corsair signing flows through a simple pipeline:

| Stage | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **EVIDENCE** | Accept structured tool output (Prowler, InSpec, Trivy, etc.) | Structured controls and evidence |
| **SIGN** | Ed25519 signed attestation with provenance | Signed CPOE (W3C Verifiable Credential) |
| **LOG** | Register in SCITT transparency log | Append-only audit trail |
| **VERIFY** | Verify signature and provenance | Verification result |
| **DIFF** | Compare CPOEs over time | Control-level changes |

Optional enrichment layers (available via `--enrich`):

- **CHART** — Map controls to 13+ compliance frameworks
- **QUARTER** — AI-powered evidence governance review
- **FLAGSHIP** — Real-time compliance change notifications (SSF/CAEP)

## Tool Adapters

Corsair accepts structured output from security scanning tools and compliance platforms. Each adapter translates tool-native formats into the canonical evidence format for signing:

- **Prowler** — AWS/Azure/GCP security scanning (JSON output)
- **InSpec** — Infrastructure compliance testing (JSON results)
- **Trivy** — Vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning (JSON reports)
- **ComplianceAsCode** — OpenSCAP-based compliance automation
- **Platform APIs** — CISO Assistant, Eramba, and other GRC platforms

## Provenance Model

Every CPOE records **provenance** — where the evidence came from. Corsair does not judge evidence quality. It records provenance, signs the result, and lets buyers decide what's sufficient.

| Source | Name | What It Means |
|--------|------|---------------|
| **self** | Self-Assessed | Organization self-attests without automated evidence |
| **tool** | Tool-Generated | Security tool (Prowler, InSpec, Trivy) produced the evidence |
| **auditor** | Auditor-Verified | Independent third party reviewed and verified the assessment |

Assurance levels (L0-L4) are available as optional enrichment via the `--enrich` flag but are not part of the default signing path.

## Evidence Chain

Every finding in Corsair is backed by a cryptographic evidence chain:

1. Each evidence record is hashed with SHA-256
2. Each hash includes the previous record's hash (chain)
3. The chain root is included in the Marque signature
4. Tampering with any record breaks the chain

This ensures evidence integrity without trusting any central authority.

## Marque Signing

A Marque is signed with Ed25519 (elliptic curve digital signature):

- **Private key**: Used by the `corsair sign` CLI to sign attestations
- **Public key**: Shared with anyone who needs to verify
- **Verification**: Runs client-side via Web Crypto API at [grcorsair.com/marque](/marque)

No server, no account, no data sharing required for verification.

## Parley Protocol

Parley is the trust exchange protocol that composes three open standards:

| Standard | Role | What It Provides |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **JWT-VC** (W3C) | Proof | CPOE as a Verifiable Credential, Ed25519-signed |
| **SCITT** (IETF) | Audit trail | Append-only transparency log with COSE receipts |
| **SSF/CAEP** (OpenID) | Signals | Real-time compliance change notifications |

Together, these ensure that compliance proofs are verifiable, auditable, and communicated in real time.
