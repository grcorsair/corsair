## Skills-First Distribution

Corsair ships with a **SKILL.md** that describes how to sign, verify, discover, and diff compliance proofs. Any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard can load the skill and run Corsair workflows without a bespoke SDK.

This keeps integration light:

- No client libraries to install
- No proprietary API lock-in
- Deterministic, auditable steps (sign, verify, trust.txt)

## Install the Skill

```bash
npx skills add grcorsair/corsair
```

The skill lives at:

```
skills/corsair/SKILL.md
```

## What Agents Can Do

- Sign tool output into CPOEs
- Verify vendor proofs via trust.txt discovery
- Diff CPOEs to detect drift
- Register proofs in SCITT logs
- Validate policy artifacts

## Why This Matters

Skills make Corsair a **compliance substrate** for agents. Instead of rebuilding scanners, agents can reuse deterministic tool output (Prowler, SecurityHub, Wiz, etc.), wrap it in cryptographic proof, and exchange it in a trust-safe format.

If you maintain your own agent harness, point it at `skills/corsair/SKILL.md` and map the commands to your runtime.
