## Overview

Corsair generates [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) Assessment Results — the NIST standard for machine-readable security assessment data.

## Output Formats

```bash
# OSCAL JSON (machine-readable, NIST SP 800-53A compliant)
bun corsair.ts ingest --input soc2-report.pdf --format oscal

# HTML report (self-contained, no external dependencies)
bun corsair.ts ingest --input soc2-report.pdf --format html

# Markdown report
bun corsair.ts ingest --input soc2-report.pdf --format md
```

## OSCAL Mapping

| Corsair Concept | OSCAL Element |
|----------------|---------------|
| Ingestion Findings | Findings (satisfied/not-satisfied) |
| CHART Frameworks | Reviewed Controls (control-selections) |
| QUARTER Governance | Observations (EXAMINE method) |
| MARQUE Attestation | Assessment Results metadata |

## Report Sections

HTML and Markdown reports include:

- **Executive Summary** — Assessment overview, assurance level, control coverage
- **Framework Coverage** — Which frameworks mapped, control counts
- **Finding Details** — Per-finding severity, evidence references, remediation context
- **Evidence Chain** — Hash chain verification, record count, integrity status
- **Assurance Summary** — L0-L4 level with per-control breakdown

## Integration with GRC Platforms

OSCAL JSON output can be ingested by:

- **ServiceNow** GRC module (via REST API import)
- **Archer** IRM (via data feed)
- **Jira** (JSONL evidence to Jira issues via webhook)
- **Drata/Vanta** (planned Corsair integration)

The OSCAL format ensures Corsair evidence is portable across any platform that supports the NIST standard.
