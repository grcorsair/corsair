## Overview

The Corsair pipeline processes security assessments through eight sequential stages. Each stage builds on the output of the previous one, creating a complete adversarial assessment with cryptographic evidence.

```
RECON → SPYGLASS → MARK → RAID → PLUNDER → CHART → QUARTER → MARQUE
```

## Stage Details

### RECON — Reconnaissance

Read-only observation of the target service. Produces a JSON snapshot of the current configuration without making any changes.

**Supported sources:**
- `aws` — Live AWS API calls (requires credentials)
- `fixture` — Pre-built demo data (no credentials needed)
- `file` — Load from a JSON file

### SPYGLASS — Threat Modeling

Applies STRIDE methodology to the RECON snapshot, identifying potential threats across six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

### MARK — Drift Detection

Compares the actual configuration against expected baselines. Detects drift in security-critical settings like MFA configuration, encryption status, and access policies.

### RAID — Attack Simulation

Executes adversarial test scenarios against the target. **DryRun=true by default** — RAID simulates attacks without making changes unless explicitly configured otherwise.

### PLUNDER — Evidence Extraction

Captures all findings into a SHA-256 hash chain (JSONL format). Each record is cryptographically linked to the previous one, creating a tamper-proof evidence trail.

### CHART — Framework Mapping

Maps findings to 13+ compliance frameworks using a 3-tier resolution system:
1. Plugin manifest mappings (highest priority)
2. CTID ATT&CK-to-NIST data (6,300+ mappings)
3. SCF crosswalk to 175+ frameworks

### QUARTER — Governance Review

AI-powered governance assessment evaluating methodology quality, evidence integrity, completeness, and bias. Produces a confidence score and trust tier.

### MARQUE — Signed Attestation

Generates an Ed25519-signed Certificate of Proof of Operational Effectiveness (CPOE) — a tamper-proof document summarizing the entire assessment.
