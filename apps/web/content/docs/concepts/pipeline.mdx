## Overview

The Corsair pipeline transforms compliance evidence into cryptographically signed, universally verifiable Certificates of Proof of Operational Effectiveness (CPOEs). Each stage builds on the previous one, progressing from raw evidence to a W3C Verifiable Credential signed with Ed25519.

```
INGEST → CHART → QUARTER → MARQUE
```

Two companion systems operate alongside the pipeline:

- **FLAGSHIP** — Real-time compliance change notifications via SSF/SET/CAEP
- **SCITT** — Append-only transparency log for CPOE registration and auditability

## Stage Details

### INGEST — Evidence Ingestion

Accepts compliance evidence (SOC 2 reports, audit artifacts, configuration exports) and extracts structured control data using Claude.

**Input sources:**
- `pdf` — SOC 2 Type II reports, audit reports, compliance documentation
- `json` — Pre-structured control data, configuration exports
- `api` — Direct integration with compliance platforms (planned)

**Output:** An `IngestedDocument` containing structured controls, evidence references, and metadata ready for framework mapping.

```bash
bun corsair.ts ingest --input ./soc2-report.pdf
```

### CHART — Framework Mapping

Maps ingested controls to 13+ compliance frameworks using a 2-tier resolution system:

1. **CTID ATT&CK-to-NIST data** — 6,300+ mappings from the Center for Threat-Informed Defense
2. **SCF crosswalk** — Secure Controls Framework mapping to 175+ frameworks

Supported frameworks include NIST 800-53, NIST CSF, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, CMMC, FedRAMP, CIS Controls, SOX, and COBIT.

### QUARTER — Governance Review

AI-powered governance assessment evaluating four dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Methodology | 30% | Assessment approach quality and rigor |
| Evidence Integrity | 25% | Cryptographic chain validity and completeness |
| Completeness | 25% | Coverage of in-scope controls |
| Bias | 20% | Independence and objectivity of evidence |

Produces a confidence score (0-100) and trust tier (self-assessed, ai-verified, or auditor-verified).

### MARQUE — Signed Attestation

Generates an Ed25519-signed CPOE as a W3C Verifiable Credential (JWT-VC). The signed attestation includes the assessment scope, control test results, evidence chain metadata, framework mappings, and the Quartermaster governance attestation.

**CPOE format:**

```
Header:  { "alg": "EdDSA", "typ": "vc+jwt", "kid": "did:web:grcorsair.com#key-1" }
Payload: { "iss": "did:web:grcorsair.com", "vc": { ... CPOE ... }, "parley": "2.0" }
Signature: Ed25519
```

**Verification:** Anyone with the issuer's public key (resolved via `did:web`) can verify the CPOE without any server, account, or data sharing.

## Assurance Levels (L0-L4)

Every CPOE is issued at an assurance level reflecting the depth of evidence behind it:

| Level | Name | Evidence Basis |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **L0** | Documented | Policy documents, self-attestation |
| **L1** | Configured | Automated configuration checks, non-manual evidence |
| **L2** | Demonstrated | Test results with Quartermaster confidence >= 70 |
| **L3** | Observed | Continuous monitoring via FLAGSHIP, re-validated within 90 days |
| **L4** | Attested | Independent auditor co-signature (Verifiable Presentation) |

The CPOE assurance level is the **minimum** across all in-scope controls. Controls can be explicitly excluded with documented rationale.

## FLAGSHIP — Real-Time Compliance Signals

FLAGSHIP delivers standardized compliance change notifications via the OpenID Shared Signals Framework (SSF) and Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP). When a CPOE's compliance posture changes, subscribers are notified immediately.

Four event types:

| Event | CAEP Mapping | Trigger |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| COLORS_CHANGED | assurance-level-change | Trust tier transition |
| FLEET_ALERT | compliance-change | Compliance drift detected |
| PAPERS_CHANGED | credential-change | CPOE issued, renewed, revoked, or expired |
| MARQUE_REVOKED | session-revoked | Emergency CPOE revocation |

## SCITT — Transparency Log

CPOEs are registered with an IETF SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) transparency service. Registration produces a COSE receipt proving inclusion in the append-only log, providing:

- **Non-repudiation** — The issuer cannot deny having issued the attestation at the recorded time
- **Discoverability** — Third parties can audit the transparency log to verify CPOE history

The SCITT registry uses SHA-256 Merkle tree hashing with COSE_Sign1 signed receipts (RFC 9052, Ed25519).
