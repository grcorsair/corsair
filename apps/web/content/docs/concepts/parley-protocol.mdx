## Overview

Parley is Corsair's **trust exchange protocol** — the mechanism by which organizations share and verify compliance attestations. Named after the pirate parley (a negotiation between parties under a flag of truce), the protocol enables trustless verification of operational effectiveness.

Parley composes three open standards into a single coherent protocol:

```
JWT-VC (proof) + SCITT (log) + SSF/CAEP (signal)
```

Each standard handles a different aspect of the trust lifecycle:

- **JWT-VC** — The attestation itself (what happened)
- **SCITT** — The public record (that it happened)
- **SSF/CAEP** — The notification (when things change)

## Three-Standard Composition

### 1. JWT-VC (The Proof)

W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 provides the **credential data model**. A CPOE becomes a VC with:

- `@context`: W3C VC 2.0 + Corsair credential context
- `type`: `["VerifiableCredential", "CorsairCPOE"]`
- `issuer`: DID of the assessing organization
- `credentialSubject`: Assessment scope, summary, evidence chain, frameworks

The JWT encoding (`vc+jwt`) means the signature IS the JWT — no separate proof object needed.

### 2. SCITT (The Log)

IETF Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust provides the **transparency log**. When a CPOE is issued, it can be registered with a SCITT transparency service:

- **Registration**: Submit the JWT-VC as a SCITT statement
- **Receipt**: Get back a COSE receipt proving inclusion in the log
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify the CPOE was registered at a specific time

SCITT ensures that CPOEs are auditable and that issuers cannot silently revoke or modify attestations without detection.

### 3. SSF/CAEP (The Signal)

OpenID Shared Signals Framework and Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol provide **real-time notifications**. When compliance status changes, subscribers are notified immediately:

- **COLORS_CHANGED**: Trust tier changed (e.g., self-assessed to ai-verified)
- **FLEET_ALERT**: Drift detected, controls degraded
- **PAPERS_CHANGED**: CPOE issued, renewed, or revoked
- **MARQUE_REVOKED**: Emergency revocation

See the [FLAGSHIP Events](/docs/concepts/flagship-events) page for details.

## End-to-End Flow

```
1. EVIDENCE  Corsair accepts structured output from security tools (Prowler, InSpec, Trivy)
2. SIGN      Provenance recorded, CPOE signed as JWT-VC with Ed25519
3. LOG       (Optional) JWT-VC registered in SCITT transparency log
4. SHARE     Vendor shares JWT-VC with requesting organization
5. VERIFY    Requestor verifies locally (Web Crypto, CLI, or any VC verifier)
6. DIFF      Compare CPOEs over time to track compliance changes
7. MONITOR   (Optional) SSF/CAEP stream delivers real-time compliance signals
8. RENEW     Periodic re-assessment produces new JWT-VC, old one expires
```

## DID Identity

Parley uses `did:web` for issuer identity. Organizations publish a DID document at their domain:

```
https://example.com/.well-known/did.json
```

This document contains the Ed25519 public key used for verification. The DID is embedded in the JWT-VC as the issuer claim, enabling automatic key discovery during verification.
