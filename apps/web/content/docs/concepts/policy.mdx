## Overview

Policy artifacts are small JSON files that encode **acceptance criteria** for verification.
They turn “trust decisions” into deterministic checks:

- Who issued the proof
- Which frameworks are required
- How fresh the evidence must be
- Whether receipts, SCITT anchors, or input binding are required

## Why It Matters

A CPOE is the proof. A policy artifact is the checklist for accepting that proof.
This keeps Corsair opinion-free while allowing each relying party to decide what is sufficient.

## Example Policy

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "Acme Procurement Baseline",
  "requireIssuer": "did:web:vendor.com",
  "requireFramework": ["SOC2"],
  "maxAgeDays": 90,
  "minScore": 85,
  "requireSource": "tool",
  "requireSourceIdentity": ["Prowler v3.1"],
  "requireReceipts": true,
  "requireScitt": true,
  "requireToolAttestation": true
}
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
corsair policy validate --file policy.json
corsair verify --file cpoe.jwt --policy policy.json
```

## trust.txt Integration

Publish a policy URL alongside proofs for discoverability:

```
POLICY: https://acme.com/.well-known/policy.json
```
