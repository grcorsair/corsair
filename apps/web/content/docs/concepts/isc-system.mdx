## Overview

ISC (Ideal State Criteria) is how Corsair defines and tracks security expectations. Each criterion is a concise, binary-testable statement that describes what "good" looks like for a specific security control.

## ISC Format

Every ISC criterion follows strict rules:

- **8 words maximum** — Concise and actionable
- **Binary outcome** — SATISFIED or FAILED, no gray area
- **Granular** — One security control per criterion
- **State, not action** — Describes the desired state, not what to do

### Examples

```
✅ "Public access block enabled at bucket level"
✅ "Multi-factor authentication enforced for all accounts"
✅ "Server-side encryption configured using AES-256 standard"
✅ "CloudTrail logging enabled with integrity validation"
```

## ISC Lifecycle

```
PENDING → SATISFIED   (control verified by MARK)
PENDING → FAILED      (control missing or weak)
```

1. **Generation** — The CorsairAgent generates ISC criteria from security knowledge of the target service
2. **Extraction** — ISCExtractor parses criteria from the agent's response
3. **Persistence** — Criteria saved to `missions/{missionId}/ISC.json`
4. **Evaluation** — MARK primitive verifies each criterion against the actual configuration
5. **Tracking** — ISCManager updates satisfaction status

## Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ISCManager` | Tracks ISC lifecycle and satisfaction |
| `ISCExtractor` | Parses ISC from agent responses |
| `ISCIndex` | Searchable ISC database across missions |
| `ISCDistributor` | Distributes ISC to parallel MARK agents |

## ISC in Reports

ISC results appear in every Corsair output:

- **OSCAL JSON** — Each criterion maps to an OSCAL Finding (satisfied/not-satisfied)
- **HTML/Markdown Reports** — ISC table with SATISFIED/FAILED status per criterion
- **Marque Documents** — ISC satisfaction rate is part of the signed attestation

## Usage

ISC criteria are generated automatically during autonomous missions:

```bash
bun corsair.ts --target demo --service cognito
```

The agent generates criteria like:

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    { "text": "MFA enforced for all user accounts", "status": "FAILED" },
    { "text": "Password minimum length exceeds twelve characters", "status": "FAILED" },
    { "text": "Account lockout enabled after failed attempts", "status": "SATISFIED" }
  ]
}
```

## Why ISC Matters

Traditional compliance asks "did you check the box?" ISC asks "does the control actually work?" By defining expectations as granular, binary criteria and then verifying them against reality, Corsair ensures that compliance evidence reflects operational truth — not documentation theater.
