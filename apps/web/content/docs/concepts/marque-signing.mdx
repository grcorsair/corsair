## What is a Marque?

A **Marque** is a cryptographically signed document that attests to the results of a Corsair adversarial assessment. Named after the historical Letter of Marque that authorized privateers, it serves as a **Certificate of Proof of Operational Effectiveness (CPOE)**.

## Signing

Corsair uses **Ed25519** (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for signing:

- Zero external dependencies — uses Node.js built-in `crypto` module
- 64-byte signatures, 32-byte keys
- Deterministic — same input always produces same signature
- Fast verification (important for client-side use)

## Trust Tiers

The Quartermaster assigns trust tiers based on the governance confidence score:

| Score | Tier | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| < 70 | Self-Assessed | Minimal governance review |
| 70-89 | AI-Verified | Automated governance passed |
| >= 90 | Auditor-Verified | Human auditor reviewed |

## Verification

Marque verification is **fully client-side** at [grcorsair.com/marque](/marque):

1. Paste the Marque JSON and the issuer's public key
2. Web Crypto API verifies the Ed25519 signature
3. Evidence chain integrity is validated
4. Expiry date is checked

No data leaves the browser. No server calls. No Corsair account needed.

## Sanitization

Before signing, Corsair sanitizes sensitive data:
- AWS Account IDs → redacted
- ARNs → redacted
- IP addresses → redacted
- File paths → redacted
- API keys → redacted

The Marque contains assessment *results*, not raw infrastructure details.
