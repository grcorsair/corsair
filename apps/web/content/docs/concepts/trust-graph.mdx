## What Is the Trust Graph?

The **trust graph** is a network of CPOEs that reference each other. Instead of re-auditing everything, you can attach upstream proofs as **dependency proofs** and verify them end-to-end.

This enables:

- Vendor attestations that include their critical suppliers
- Shared controls across subsidiaries without re-issuing everything
- Composable trust decisions across multiple issuers

## Dependency Proofs

Each dependency proof includes:

- The issuer DID
- The scope of the referenced CPOE
- A hash of the dependency CPOE
- An optional URL to fetch the dependency

Example:

```json
{
  "issuer": "did:web:vendor.com",
  "scope": "SOC 2 Type II — Infrastructure",
  "cpoe": "https://vendor.com/cpoe.jwt",
  "digest": "sha256:4b2c...d91"
}
```

## Attach Dependencies When Signing

```bash
corsair sign --file evidence.json \
  --dependency https://vendor.com/cpoe.jwt
```

## Verify the Dependency Chain

```bash
corsair verify --file cpoe.jwt --dependencies
corsair verify --file cpoe.jwt --dependencies --dependency-depth 2
```

Corsair verifies:

- Ed25519 signature via DID:web for each dependency
- Digest match against the recorded hash
- Optional nested dependencies (depth > 1)
