## Overview

The AWS Lambda plugin tests serverless function security — unauthenticated function URLs, outdated runtimes, exposed secrets in environment variables, and missing concurrency guardrails.

## Attack Vectors

### Unauthenticated Function URL (`unauthenticated-function-url`)

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**MITRE ATT&CK:** T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application)

Detects Lambda function URLs configured with `AuthType: NONE`, exposing the function to unauthenticated invocations from the internet.

### Outdated Runtime (`outdated-runtime`)

**Severity:** HIGH
**MITRE ATT&CK:** T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution)

Checks whether the function uses a deprecated or end-of-life runtime version (e.g., Node.js 14.x, Python 3.7) that no longer receives security patches.

### Environment Variable Exposure (`env-var-exposure`)

**Severity:** HIGH
**MITRE ATT&CK:** T1552 (Unsecured Credentials)

Scans environment variable names for patterns that suggest embedded secrets (API keys, database passwords, tokens) that should be stored in Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store instead.

### Missing Concurrency Limit (`missing-concurrency-limit`)

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**MITRE ATT&CK:** T1499 (Endpoint Denial of Service)

Checks whether reserved concurrency is configured to prevent a single function from consuming the entire account's Lambda concurrency pool during a denial-of-service attack.
