Today we shipped v0.5.0, which removes assurance levels (L0-L4) from the default CPOE signing path. This was a deliberate design decision, not a simplification. Here's why.

## What Changed

Before v0.5.0, every `corsair sign` command ran the full pipeline: EVIDENCE → CLASSIFY → CHART → QUARTER → MARQUE. The CLASSIFY stage assigned an assurance level (L0-L4) to every control based on evidence type. The QUARTER stage ran an AI governance review. Both were mandatory.

Now, the default path is: EVIDENCE → SIGN. Provenance is recorded. The credential is signed. That's it.

CLASSIFY, CHART, and QUARTER are still available via `--enrich`. They haven't been deleted — they've been moved out of the critical path.

## The Problem with Assurance Levels

L0-L4 assurance levels were our invention. We defined what L1 meant (config evidence), what L2 required (test results + AI confidence >= 70), how L3 worked (continuous monitoring). The definitions were reasonable. The problem was deeper.

**Corsair was judging evidence quality.** An L2 CPOE said "Corsair reviewed this evidence and determined it meets our L2 standard." That made Corsair a gatekeeper — the thing we set out to replace.

Compare this to git. When you `git commit`, git doesn't evaluate whether your code is good. It records what changed, who changed it, and when. The commit is a fact, not a judgment. Code review happens separately, by whoever cares to look.

## The Provenance-First Model

Now, every CPOE records **provenance** — where the evidence came from:

- **self** — Organization self-attests without automated evidence
- **tool** — Security tool (Prowler, InSpec, Trivy) produced the evidence
- **auditor** — Independent third party verified the assessment

Corsair does not judge. It records. The buyer decides what's sufficient.

This is a fundamental shift. Instead of Corsair saying "this evidence is L2-quality," the CPOE says "Prowler v3.1 produced this evidence on January 15th, 2026." The buyer can then decide: "We require tool-generated evidence for all vendors" or "We accept self-assessed for low-risk vendors."

## Why This Is Better

**1. No gatekeeper.** Corsair signs what you give it. The provenance is recorded honestly. There's no L1 gate that rejects your CPOE because a control had manual evidence.

**2. Buyer-set thresholds.** Different buyers have different risk appetites. A startup evaluating a design tool might accept self-assessed provenance. A bank evaluating a payments processor might require auditor-verified. The CPOE format supports both without Corsair picking sides.

**3. Deterministic path.** The default signing path has zero AI, zero LLM calls, zero judgment. Parse the JSON, record provenance, compute summary, sign with Ed25519. Fully reproducible. The same input always produces the same CPOE.

**4. Composable enrichment.** If you want framework mapping, add `--enrich`. If you want AI governance review, it's there. But these are layers you opt into, not gates you must pass through.

## The Git Analogy

We've started describing Corsair as "git for compliance":

- `corsair sign` is like `git commit` — record what happened
- `corsair diff` is like `git diff` — see what changed between assessments
- `corsair log` is like `git log` — browse the SCITT transparency history
- `corsair verify` is like checking a GPG signature — cryptographic proof of authorship

Git doesn't evaluate code quality. It tracks changes with integrity. Corsair doesn't evaluate compliance quality. It records evidence with provenance and cryptographic proof.

## What Stays

The assurance calculator (`src/ingestion/assurance-calculator.ts`) is still there — 1,700+ lines of classification logic. It's available via `--enrich` for teams that want L0-L4 scoring. The Quartermaster governance review is still there. CHART framework mapping is still there.

Nothing was deleted. The critical path was simplified.

## What's Next

With the default path simplified, we're focused on tool integration. `corsair sign --format prowler`, `corsair sign --format inspec`, `corsair sign --format trivy` — making it trivial to sign the output of tools teams already use.

The protocol is the product. The simpler the signing path, the faster adoption moves.
