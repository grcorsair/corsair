The compliance industry has a dirty secret: most of what we call "compliance evidence" isn't evidence at all.

It's documentation about documentation.

## The Documentation Problem

When an auditor asks "do you have MFA enabled?", they accept a **screenshot** as proof. A PDF export. A self-attested questionnaire response. The answer tells you what someone *wrote down*. It tells you nothing about whether the control *actually works* — or whether the screenshot was taken six months ago.

This is the fundamental gap that Corsair addresses.

## From Trust to Proof

The $8.57 billion TPRM market is built on trust, not verification. Vendors self-attest to 300+ questions. Customers review the answers. Nobody cryptographically proves that controls are effective.

Consider the difference:

- **Traditional approach**: Document that MFA is configured → export a screenshot → attach to questionnaire → move on
- **Corsair approach**: Ingest compliance evidence → map to frameworks → verify governance criteria → sign a cryptographic attestation that anyone can verify

The attestation that emerges from cryptographic proof is fundamentally different from the evidence produced by documentation review. It's the difference between someone telling you the door is locked and handing you a mathematically verifiable proof.

## The CPOE: A New Unit of Trust

When Corsair processes compliance evidence, it generates a **Certificate of Proof of Operational Effectiveness (CPOE)** — a W3C Verifiable Credential signed with Ed25519 that proves:

1. Which controls were assessed
2. What evidence was evaluated
3. What governance criteria were applied
4. A tamper-proof, cryptographically signed attestation

We call this a **Marque** — named after the historical Letter of Marque that authorized privateers. A Corsair Marque authorizes trust through proof, not promises.

CPOEs are the compliance equivalent of Pieces of Eight — universally verifiable. Anyone with the issuer's public key can verify the attestation. No proprietary tooling required. No vendor lock-in. Just Ed25519 and a JWT library.

## What This Means for the Industry

The $62B GRC market is built on a fundamental assumption: that compliance questionnaires and documentation reviews are sufficient to assess security posture. Corsair challenges that assumption by introducing cryptographic proof as the standard.

The question isn't "are you compliant?" anymore.

The question is: **verify trust, don't assume it.**
