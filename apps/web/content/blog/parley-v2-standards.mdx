Today we're shipping **Parley v2** — the standards-based evolution of Corsair's trust exchange protocol. CPOEs (Certificates of Proof of Operational Effectiveness) are now W3C Verifiable Credentials, compliance changes are broadcast via OpenID SSF/CAEP, and transparency logging follows the IETF SCITT architecture.

## The Problem: Proprietary Lock-In

Corsair v1 Marques were effective but proprietary. An Ed25519-signed JSON document with a Corsair-specific structure. To verify one, you needed Corsair tooling or intimate knowledge of the format.

This creates a problem: if the goal is to replace questionnaire theater with cryptographic proof, the proof format itself can't be a walled garden. A vendor shouldn't need to convince their customer to install specific tooling just to verify an attestation.

The entire point of Pieces of Eight was universal verifiability. Anyone could cut, weigh, and bite a silver coin. CPOEs need the same property.

## Three Standards, One Protocol

Parley v2 composes three open standards:

**W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0** — The credential envelope. A CPOE is now a VC with `type: ["VerifiableCredential", "CorsairCPOE"]`, encoded as a JWT with `alg: EdDSA`. Any VC verifier can validate it. The Ed25519 signing is unchanged — the same key, the same algorithm. The container is now standard.

**OpenID SSF / CAEP** — Real-time compliance signals. We call this module **FLAGSHIP** (the command ship that signals fleet-wide changes). When a vendor's compliance status changes — drift detected, trust tier upgraded, credential revoked — subscribers get a standardized Security Event Token immediately. No more quarterly reviews to discover that MFA was disabled three months ago.

**IETF SCITT** — Transparency logging. When a CPOE is issued, it can be registered in a SCITT append-only log. This provides non-repudiation (the issuer can't deny the attestation) and discoverability (anyone can audit the history). SCITT interfaces are defined in this release; full transparency service integration tracks the IETF draft.

## What Changes

### The JWT-VC Envelope

A v1 Marque:
```json
{
  "marque": { "id": "mrq_...", "summary": {...} },
  "signature": "base64-ed25519-sig"
}
```

A v2 CPOE:
```
eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6InZjK2p3dCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJkaWQ6d2ViOmV4YW1wbGUuY29tIi...
```

Same Ed25519 key. Same signing. But the JWT format is understood by every identity platform, security tool, and compliance system that supports VCs.

### DID Identity

Organizations identify themselves with `did:web` — a DID that resolves to a JSON document at their domain. The public key is published at `example.com/.well-known/did.json`. Verifiers can automatically discover the key from the JWT header's `kid` claim.

### FLAGSHIP Events

Four CAEP event types, with pirate names:

| Event | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **COLORS_CHANGED** | Trust tier transition |
| **FLEET_ALERT** | Drift detected |
| **PAPERS_CHANGED** | CPOE lifecycle event |
| **MARQUE_REVOKED** | Emergency revocation |

Events are encoded as RFC 8417 Security Event Tokens and delivered via push or poll.

## What Stays the Same

Everything that matters:

- **Ed25519 signing** — Same algorithm, same keys, same deterministic signatures
- **Evidence chains** — SHA-256 hash chains with tamper-proof integrity
- **Pirate names** — RECON, SPYGLASS, MARK, RAID, PLUNDER, CHART, QUARTER, MARQUE
- **Client-side verification** — The [web verifier](/marque) now auto-detects format
- **Zero external signing dependencies** — Node.js crypto module for key generation and signing

The core thesis hasn't changed: attack first, discover reality, evidence emerges. We just wrapped the evidence in a better container.

## Migration Path

Both v1 and v2 formats are fully supported. The CLI accepts `--format marque` (v1) or `--format vc-jwt` (v2). The web verifier auto-detects and handles both.

There is no forced migration. v1 Marques continue to verify. Organizations can adopt v2 when they're ready for interoperable credentials.

## What's Next

- **SCITT transparency service integration** — Full append-only log for CPOE registration
- **Selective disclosure** — SD-JWT support for sharing partial assessment results
- **FLAGSHIP push delivery** — Webhook-based real-time event delivery to GRC platforms
- **Credential exchange** — Automated vendor-to-customer CPOE sharing workflows

The goal remains: replace the $8.57 billion questionnaire theater industry with cryptographic proof. Parley v2 makes that proof interoperable.
