In the 16th century, the Spanish dollar — known as **Pieces of Eight** — became the world's first truly global currency. It worked not because of the authority of Spain, but because of a remarkable property: **anyone could verify it**.

Cut a Piece of Eight into pieces. Weigh it. Bite it to test for lead filling. The verification was built into the artifact itself, not dependent on trusting the issuer.

## The Verification Gap

Modern trust infrastructure has the opposite problem. We rely on **attestations of authority** rather than **verifiable artifacts**:

| Trust Mechanism | Verification Method | Trustworthy? |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| SOC2 Type II Report | "Trust the auditor" | Somewhat |
| Security Questionnaire | "Trust the vendor" | Not really |
| Penetration Test Report | "Trust the pentest firm" | Depends |
| **Corsair CPOE** | **Verify the signature** | **Mathematically** |

A CPOE is verifiable by anyone, anywhere, without trusting Corsair, the vendor, or any intermediary. The Ed25519 signature is the mathematical equivalent of cutting, weighing, and biting.

## The Dual Encoding

Every concept in Corsair carries dual meaning — pirate brand on the surface, functional description underneath:

- **CPOE** = **C**orsair **P**ieces **o**f **E**ight = **C**ertificate of **P**roof of **O**perational **E**ffectiveness
- **Marque** = Letter of Marque (privateer license) = the signed CPOE document
- **Parley** = Pirate negotiation protocol = the trust exchange protocol

This isn't just branding. The historical parallels are structurally meaningful. Pieces of Eight succeeded because verification was decentralized. CPOEs succeed for the same reason.

## What Comes Next

The CPOE is the atomic unit of a new trust infrastructure. When enough organizations generate and exchange CPOEs, the network effect creates a **trust graph** — a web of cryptographically verified security assessments that replaces the current web of unverified questionnaires.

This is how you disrupt an $8.57 billion market: not by building a better questionnaire, but by making questionnaires obsolete.
