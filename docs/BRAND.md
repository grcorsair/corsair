# Corsair - Brand Identity

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Finalized

---

## Name

**Corsair**

Single word, lowercase for CLI usage:
```bash
$ corsair
```

---

## Tagline

**"Sanctioned chaos. Validated security."**

Alternative taglines:
- "Authorized raiders of compliance"
- "Break it before they do"
- "Letters of marque for your infrastructure"

---

## Full Brand Name

**Corsair Security** or **Corsair Labs**

Use in marketing materials, website, company formation.

---

## Positioning Statement

"Corsair is the first agentic platform that validates compliance through adversarial chaos engineering. Like historical corsairs who held letters of marque to raid enemy ships, Corsair gives security teams authorization to attack their own infrastructure—finding the gaps between documented compliance and actual security."

---

## The Metaphor

**Ships with 100 cannons but unlocked cargo holds.**

- **Ships** = GRC programs (documented, certified, "compliant")
- **100 cannons** = Pages of policies, frameworks, SOC2/ISO27001 certifications
- **Unlocked cargo hold** = Actual security gaps despite documentation
- **Corsairs** = Authorized raiders who expose these gaps through chaos

**Core Insight:** Most compliance programs are over-documented but under-secured. Corsair raids your infrastructure to prove your controls actually work under adversarial conditions.

---

## Visual Identity

### Aesthetic
**Pixel art / 8-bit retro gaming**

Aligns with founder's brand as GRC content creator.

### Mascot
**Captain [Ayoub]** - Pixel art pirate character

Elements:
- Tricorn hat with compliance framework badges (SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA)
- Cutlass = chaos injection tool
- Spyglass = observation/monitoring
- Treasure map = compliance evidence chain
- Pirate flag with frameworks as skull & crossbones

### Color Palette
- **Navy blue** (ocean, authority)
- **Gold** (treasure, value)
- **Red** (danger, chaos, alerts)
- **White** (clarity, evidence)

### Logo Concepts
1. Pirate flag with compliance frameworks as skull & crossbones
2. Corsair ship silhouette with chaos waves
3. Pixel art captain character icon

---

## Tone & Voice

### Brand Personality
- **Aggressive but authorized** (sanctioned chaos)
- **Technical depth** (security engineers, not compliance officers)
- **Pirate culture** (raids, plunder, mutiny) mixed with professional security
- **Playful but serious** (retro gaming aesthetic meets real security)

### Writing Style
- Action-oriented commands: `recon`, `raid`, `plunder`, `chart`, `escape`, `parley`
- Pirate terminology aligned with 6 primitives
- Technical precision (not cutesy)
- First-person from Captain's perspective in blog/content

### Command Taxonomy (Pirate-Themed Primitives)
- **RECON** (`corsair recon`) - Scout the territory (reconnaissance)
- **MARK** - Identify targets (implicit in raid planning)
- **RAID** (`corsair raid`) - Execute attack campaigns
- **PLUNDER** (`corsair plunder`) - Extract evidence artifacts
- **CHART** (`corsair chart`) - Map compliance territory
- **ESCAPE** - Clean getaway (automatic rollback)
- **PARLEY** (`corsair parley`) - Negotiate with port authorities (generate reports)

### Examples
- **Documentation:** "The Corsair's Charter" (not "Docs")
- **Community:** "The Crew"
- **Blog:** "Captain's Log"
- **Releases:** "Voyages" (Voyage 1.0, Voyage 2.0)
- **CLI output:** "Hoisting the colors...", "RAID: executing attack...", "PLUNDER: evidence captured...", "ESCAPE: clean getaway..."

---

## Domain Strategy

### Primary Options
1. **corsairsec.io** (Corsair Security)
2. **getcorsair.io** (common pattern: getdbt.com, etc.)
3. **corsair.sh** (CLI tool domain)
4. **corsairaudit.com** (explicit positioning)

### Fallback
If premium domains unavailable: **corsair.ai** or **corsair.dev**

### Handle Corsair Gaming Collision
- Different visual identity (pirate vs gaming RGB)
- Clear positioning: "Corsair Security" vs "Corsair Gaming"
- SEO: Target "compliance", "chaos engineering", "GRC" keywords
- Social: @corsairsec (not just @corsair)

---

## Marketing Copy

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"Corsair validates your compliance through chaos engineering. We're authorized raiders who attack your infrastructure to prove your controls actually work—not just that you documented them. Think red team meets continuous compliance."

### Longer Pitch (2 minutes)
"Most companies pass SOC2 audits but still get breached. Why? Because compliance frameworks check if you *documented* security controls, not if they *actually work under attack*. Corsair solves this.

We're like historical corsairs—authorized by government to raid enemy ships. Corsair gives your security team 'letters of marque' to chaos-test your own infrastructure. We inject entropy, simulate attacks, and validate that your MFA, encryption, access controls actually hold up when adversaries probe for weaknesses.

It's continuous compliance validation through adversarial chaos engineering. Red team rigor, automated and continuous."

---

## Target Audience

### Primary
**Security Engineers & SREs at high-compliance tech companies**

- Need: Prove controls work, not just documented
- Pain: Manual compliance, checkbox auditing, post-breach "but we were compliant!"
- Pitch: "Automate red team validation of your compliance controls"

### Secondary
**CISOs & Security Leaders at financial services / healthcare**

- Need: Demonstrate control effectiveness to regulators
- Pain: Auditors want proof, not attestations
- Pitch: "Immutable evidence that your controls withstand adversarial testing"

### Tertiary
**DevSecOps teams at security-first startups**

- Need: Compliance without slowing down engineering
- Pain: Traditional GRC is heavyweight, doesn't integrate with CI/CD
- Pitch: "Terminal-native chaos testing for compliance—ships with your code"

## Product Positioning

### Category
**Adversarial Compliance Automation**

We're creating a new category—not traditional GRC (Vanta, Drata) and not pure chaos engineering (Gremlin, Chaos Mesh).

### Competitive Positioning

| Category | Example | What They Miss |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Traditional GRC** | Vanta, Drata | Static checks, no adversarial validation |
| **Chaos Engineering** | Gremlin, Steadybit | No compliance mapping, no audit trail |
| **BAS (Attack Simulation)** | Cymulate, SafeBreach | Predetermined scenarios, not self-building |
| **Pentesting Automation** | Hacker AI | Manual, not continuous, no chaos injection |
| **Corsair** | - | **Continuous + Adversarial + Chaos + Self-building + Evidence** |

### Key Differentiators
1. ✅ **Adversarial by design** (assume controls fail)
2. ✅ **Chaos-driven** (entropy injection, not static checks)
3. ✅ **Self-building** (learns patterns, generates tests)
4. ✅ **Red team rigor** (security depth, not checkboxes)
5. ✅ **AI-native** (agentic, not rule-based)

---

## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Brand Establishment (Month 1-2)
- Domain acquisition (corsairsec.io)
- Logo & visual identity (pixel art mascot)

- Social presence (@corsairsec on X/LinkedIn)

### Phase 2: Content Marketing (Month 2-4)
- "Captain's Log" blog series
- "Why compliance programs are ships with 100 cannons and unlocked cargo holds"
- Technical deep dives on chaos engineering for GRC
- Pixel art GIF demos of CLI

### Phase 3: MVP Launch (Month 4-6)
- Dev/staging chaos validation (no production yet)
- Manual approval gates
- JSONL evidence collection
- Initial customers: security-first startups

## Trademark & Legal

**Status:** Need to check
- [ ] Trademark search for "Corsair" in security/software category
- [ ] Corsair Gaming likely has trademark in gaming peripherals (different class)
- [ ] "Corsair Security" or "Corsair Labs" might be clear
- [ ] Consult IP attorney before fundraising/launch

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Name finalized:** Corsair
2. ⬜ **Domain acquisition:** corsairsec.io or getcorsair.io
3. ⬜ **Visual identity:** Commission pixel art mascot
4. ⬜ **Repository update:** Rename from grc-chaos-engineering
5. ⬜ **Documentation:** Update all docs with Corsair branding
6. ⬜ **CLI theming:** Design pirate-themed output
