## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Ahoy, Security Researcher!**

If you've discovered a vulnerability in CORSAIR, we want to hear from you.

### How to Report

2. Email security concerns to: security@grcengineer.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- Status update within 7 days
- Credit in release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)

### Scope

CORSAIR is an offensive security testing tool. The following are NOT vulnerabilities:

- Evidence files contain sensitive data from tested systems (expected behavior)
- The tool requires elevated permissions to function (by design)

**Fair winds and following seas, security researcher.**
